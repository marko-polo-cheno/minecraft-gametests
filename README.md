# Project

This repo contains sample GameTest behavior files for Minecraft Bedrock Edition.  Minecraft supports GameTests - a combination of JavaScript + MCStructures - for validating facets of Minecraft behavior.  You can use GameTests to validate facets of your creations, as well! 



## Getting started with GameTest

To get started with GameTest Framework in Minecraft, see this [GameTest Framework Introduction](https://aka.ms/gametest) page.  

A tutorial for creating your first GameTest is available [here](https://aka.ms/newgametest). The sample code for the tutorial is within this repo, at [/behavior_packs/StarterTestsTutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-gametests/tree/main/behavior_packs/StarterTestsTutorial).

## Using these behavior packs

To use these behavior packs with an installed Windows 10 version of Minecraft Bedrock Edition:

1. Copy the desired behavior packs into the `development_behavior_packs` (`%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\development_behavior_packs`) folder
2. Create a new world in Minecraft with the following options:

* Enable the GameTest Framework Experiment
* Set to Creative mode
* Add the desired Behavior packs

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. For the GameTests you'd like to submit for inclusion in this sample repo, please make sure:

  * the GameTest(s) are small and self contained
  * can run in a short amount of time, with clear pass/fail criteria
  * are generally passing, or used to document an unexpected failure and are tagged as such (with the .tag function on .register)
  * do not have any external dependencies (e.g., on extra behavior or resource packs)
